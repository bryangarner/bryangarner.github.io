Remains of a small steamer named the Arakanapka, which sank in 1878, can be found just northeast of the tower. ",

The concessionaire takes divers out to a small wall in this area, where a drift dive allows the diver to be swept along by the Gulf Stream, moving effortlessly past the scenery.

It's once heavy cargo of barrels filled with cement have turned into concrete tubes. These heavy cylinders litter the sandy ocean bottom and are now encrusted with marine life, including massive pillar coral. Since this Florida Keys dive site is further out from Key Largo, it's not frequented as often. The area is less busy, the fish are more numerous, and in the case of the pillar coral, quite massive. At the north end you'll be surprised to find large colonies of these stony coral monsters towering upwards of 10 feet.

In fact, this is considered to be one of the more dangerous reefs in the Florida Keys. Over the centuries, this reef has wrecked numerous ships. On your next Key West dive you should easily be able to discover scattered bits and pieces of their remains. Many of these remnants will be encrusted with coral, while some will be partially buried in the sandy bottom. If you're scuba diving in Key West, you, or your companions, will find that this is also a great Florida Keys snorkeling site. At the lighthouse, the water is the shallowest at 4 feet in depth. Further out, it drops to a depth of 94 feet making this also good for reef diving. This diversity in depth is one of the reasons why diving parties pick this site. It's the perfect combination for groups that include advanced divers, novices, and snorkelers.",

            "Info":"A no-access buffer zone out to 50 meters from shore is in effect between April 1 and August 31 and the shoal area is closed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. For centuries, Pelican Shoal located 6 miles offshore of Boca Chica, was an important nesting area for the roseate and bridled terns. The quarter acre island comprised of coral was high enough that the nests stayed safe. The birds were surrounded by an abundance of food, and due to the further out location, the human traffic was minimal so the nests weren't disturbed. However that all changed during the bad hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005. This tiny island that had been an important part of these bird's life cycle was severely decimated. All that was left was a pile of rubble. Since then, there's been no sign of these birds returning to nest amongst the island's remains. Due to the importance of this 'island', especially for the nesting habits of the roseate tern, the area has now been designated a critical Wildlife Management Area by the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. This coral reef itself is a less developed spur and groove formation than what you would typically see in the area. In particular it lacks much of the development that is so obvious at the more heavily trafficked Looe Key Reef. This site is also too far east for most dive centers from Key West FL to travel. Divers interested in a day trip here will have better luck contacting a Florida Keys dive centers located in Cudjoe Key or Summerland Key.",

This famous Key Largo statue was designed in 1961 and was finally positioned in 1965. The status is also a very substantial work of art. With it's concrete base, the 8.5 foot tall bronze statue weighs close to 20,000 pounds. It also rises up to within 11 feet of the water's surface as the statue arms rise upward to the sky. One of the best features of this popular Key Largo diving site, is that even though the statue sits at about 25 feet in depth, it's still readily visible for anyone Florida Keys snorkeling high above. This is due to the area's ultra clear water. Not only is this a well known as one of the best snorkeling and scuba diving Key Largo sites, it's extremely popular for underwater weddings and funerals. This is also one of the best Key Largo diving sites for underwater photography. The combination of beautiful coral, tropical fish and the statue in the background create the perfect composition. This Florida Keys diving site also benefits from being close to Key Largo and John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park. Plus there are numerous buoys to tie off at, so access to the area is even easier.

Sometimes these nursery corals originate as small colonies rescued from seawall and nearshore construction projects. Other times they may have been small corals salvaged from a vessel grounding. These rescued corals are given a second chance when they are moved to an underwater nursery. In the nursery, they may be attached to pedestals on blocks on the seafloor, hung on line nurseries that look like clothes lines, or placed in baskets suspended off the seafloor. The rescued corals are cared for by biologists and volunteers who monitor their health and growth and keep algae, encrusting sponges, and tunicates at bay. The goal of biologists is to transplant nursery-reared corals back out on the reef to bolster existing coral colonies, to re-seed reefs after major events, and to increase the likelihood of a diversity of coral colonies being near enough to each other for successful cross-fertilization during sexual reproduction. In 2009, transplanted corals were documented spawning for the first time in the sanctuary. Sanctuary partners were awarded $3.3 million through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to support efforts in the Florida Keys and Caribbean to improve genetic diversity and increase numbers of threatened corals, while also creating blue-green jobs.",

The U-shaped reef is about 200 yards long and 800 yards wide and is made up of standard patch reefs and outer banks. Much of the area is shallow, and this makes this reef one of the best snorkel and novice Florida Keys dive sites. However, it can also accommodate the intermediate to advanced diver who ventures to the outer banks. Here you'll find water 30 - 40' deep, and at the south end it steeply descends to about 100' where the current gets stronger and makes for good drift diving. At this greater depth you'll encounter the larger game fish such as grouper, various pelagic species, plus large barrel sponges and even rare black coral. With the area being fully protected, the marine life, including the coral has had an opportunity to thrive. You'll be surprised by the diversity that surrounds you.
