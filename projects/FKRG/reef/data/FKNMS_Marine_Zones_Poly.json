The 1.5 square nautical mile area is one of the best developed reef systems in the Keys. Carysfort has an unusual 'double reef' configuration. There is a proliferation of shallow corals, perfect for snorkeling near the lighthouse, but these thin out as the depth gradually increases. To the south of Carysfort Lighthouse, a broad expanse of elkhorn coral forms Carysfort South, a large shallow reef. Offshore, massive star corals loom over a labyrinth of under ridges, gullies, and an occasional swim-through tunnel. Carysfort is located within the boundaries of the Key Largo Existing Management Area, formerly Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary.",

The spurs are ridges of coral five to 20 feet deep, with grooves of sandy bottom between cliff-like structures. Fire coral abounds in several sections of the reef. The northwest side of the reef has coral heads and mixed rubble in close proximity to the lagoon. The south side of the reef gradually slopes away to a gentle ledge at about 65 feet, dropping to 90 feet in some places. In the shallows are artifacts from the original brick lighthouse, which blew away in an 1846 storm. Visibility at Sand Key can be highly variable, ranging from 15 to 110 feet, depending on the wind, wave action, and monthly tide variations.",

The area contains diverse habitats, including seagrass beds, coral reef habitats, (e.g., patch reefs, fore reefs, intermediate, and deep reefs), and hardbottom areas. The deep coral reefs of the Tortugas are the crown jewel of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, one of America's last wild ocean places. Clean, clear water and powerful ocean currents fuel the diversity of life in the region. Coral here is healthier and more abundant than anywhere else in the Florida Keys. Because of its isolation, the Tortugas region also has the best water quality in the sanctuary. The Tortugas region forms a crossroads of major ocean currents, which carry larvae of fish, lobster, and other creatures downstream to the Florida Keys and other coastal nurseries. These same currents bring larvae of fish and other creatures to the Tortugas from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. As a result, more than 400 species of reef fish inhabit the region, including all species of grouper. Research suggests some tuna species may use the Tortugas as a spawning ground, and about 40 species of sharks pass through the region. The Tortugas region owes its very name to the sea turtles once found here in abundance, later decimated by commercial fishing in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Green, loggerhead, Kemp's Ridley, hawksbill and leatherback turtles still travel these waters, protected now from capture.",

            "Name":"Tortugas Ecological Reserve South",
            "Info":"The Dry Tortugas are located at the westernmost extent of the Keys. The area contains diverse habitats, including seagrass beds, coral reef habitats, (e.g., patch reefs, fore reefs, intermediate, and deep reefs), and hardbottom areas. The deep coral reefs of the Tortugas are the crown jewel of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, one of America's last wild ocean places. Clean, clear water and powerful ocean currents fuel the diversity of life in the region. Coral here is healthier and more abundant than anywhere else in the Florida Keys. Because of its isolation, the Tortugas region also has the best water quality in the sanctuary. The Tortugas region forms a crossroads of major ocean currents, which carry larvae of fish, lobster, and other creatures downstream to the Florida Keys and other coastal nurseries. These same currents bring larvae of fish and other creatures to the Tortugas from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. As a result, more than 400 species of reef fish inhabit the region, including all species of grouper. Research suggests some tuna species may use the Tortugas as a spawning ground, and about 40 species of sharks pass through the region. The Tortugas region owes its very name to the sea turtles once found here in abundance, later decimated by commercial fishing in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Green, loggerhead, Kemp's Ridley, hawksbill and leatherback turtles still travel these waters, protected now from capture.",

            "Info":"The Western Sambo Ecological Reserve contains the greatest habitat diversity in the Lower Keys. Significant coral features include spur-and-groove formations, bank reefs, and nearshore patch reefs. A rectangular nine-square nautical mile area, Western Sambo Ecological Reserve begins at the water's edge off the sandy beaches and salt ponds of Boca Chica Naval Air Station. It continues through nearshore hardbottom and inshore patch reefs, out across midchannel reefs in Hawk Channel, over offshore patch reefs and the shallow bank reef, and ends at a depth of 60 feet. Western Sambo has one of the last remaining stands of living elkhorn coral in the Lower Keys, a species once abundant throughout the Keys. Anemones, crabs, starfish, sea cucumbers, sand dollars, and sea urchins are found nearshore. Surgeonfish, bar jacks, foureye butterflyfish, rosy blennies, neon gobies, grunts, wrasses, angelfish, damselfish, striped parrotfish, butter hamlets, sharpnosed puffers, and schoolmasters are residents at the reef. Huge gray angelfish and hogfish meander the shallow areas of Western Sambo.",
